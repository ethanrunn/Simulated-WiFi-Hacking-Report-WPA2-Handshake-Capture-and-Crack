# üõ†Ô∏è Simulated WiFi Hacking Report: WPA2 Handshake Capture and Crack

## üìå Objective

To ethically demonstrate a **WPA2 WiFi password crack** using a publicly available `.cap` file and a dictionary-based brute-force approach, without the use of any physical router or real-world WiFi network.

## üß™ Lab Setup

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

* **Kali Linux** (VM)
* **Aircrack-ng 1.7**
* **Wireshark**
* **rockyou.txt** (Kali default wordlist)

### üßæ Files Used

* **Capture File:** `wpa.full.cap` (downloaded from [Aircrack-ng‚Äôs official site](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=wpa_capture))
* **Wordlist:** `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

## üîç Process and Steps

This task involved using a wifi router to initiate a wireless connection and then capturing the traffic and WPA2 handshake using Wireshark. I didn‚Äôt have a physical router, so I ‚Äúsimulated‚Äù by going to Aircrack-ng‚Äôs official website and downloading a .cap file that had captured a WPA2 handshake (wpa.full.cap).

Opened up the file in Wireshark and applied the filter ‚Äúeapol‚Äù to locate handshake packets. Identified the BSSID of the access point (via Transmitter/BSSID field).

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Recommendations

To prevent this kind of WiFi attack in real environments:

1. **Use WPA3:** Stronger encryption and protections against dictionary attacks.
2. **Set Strong Passwords:** Use long, complex, non-dictionary-based passphrases.
3. **Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup):** Commonly exploited in brute-force attacks.
4. **MAC Filtering:** Restrict device access based on MAC addresses.
5. **Segment Your Network:** Keep critical devices (e.g., CCTV, servers) on separate VLANs.
6. **Regularly Update Firmware:** Keep your router‚Äôs firmware patched and up to date.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Consideration

This exercise was conducted in a fully controlled **lab environment** using public capture files. No real network was targeted or accessed. This simulation is strictly for educational purposes and security awareness.
